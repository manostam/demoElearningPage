                    <p>The textbook is intended for teaching the basic theory of probability and developing some of its fundamental applications in statistics and computer science. It is primarily aimed at first-year students in departments of computer science, mathematics, and statistics, but it is also suitable for engineering students due to the wide range of topics covered. The content includes key concepts such as probability events, axiomatic foundations, major distributions, discrete and continuous random variables, the law of large numbers, and the central limit theorem. The book is ideal for programs with limited mathematical background, helping students understand the distinct mindset of probability theory compared to other mathematical subjects.</p>
