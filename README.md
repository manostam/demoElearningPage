# demoElearningPage
A demo website displaying an e-learning platform, showcasing the use of CSS and JS for the display of HTML content at a webpage. 
At the demonstrating webpage, CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout have been used along with responsive web design (aiding to the adjustment to different screen sizes). The webpage is accompanied by a mockup HTML form for the registration of a user. Javascript's constraint validation API was used to aid to validations of the form fields.
